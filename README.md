#### Final project for the "JavaScript essentials" course of the IBM Fullstack Javascript Developer course

https://www.coursera.org/learn/javascript-programming-essentials/


### Although this was not required for the course, I turned this project into a Fullstack Web Application by setting up a simple express server, which basically does some routing and allowed me to run and test Javascript code locally.


## For running this project on your local machine:

1) Prepare a new folder for the project. inside this folder, clone this repository:
git clone git@github.com:BlackSquirrel34/travellersLounge.git

2) In case you don't have npm, install it.
Once ```npm --version``` shows you have it installed, install dependencies:
```npm install express```
and set up the new project: ```npm init```  

3) To start the server, change to the travelRecommendation directory, and run: 
```node index.js``` Output should say server running on (port) 3005.

4) Your'e now ready to visit localhost:3005 and explore the website's functionality.
