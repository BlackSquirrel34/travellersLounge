// task 6: fetch data
// fetch data from the travel_recommendation_api.json file using the fetch API method, 
// from there you can fetch travel-related details, such as the name of the place. 
// You need to have your own images for every imageUrl in the JSON file.

// >> see healthcare website

// Fetch the data from the JSON using the fetch API() method. 
// To check if you can access the data, you use console.log to see if the result is displayed.

// It is good if the console.log logs the data. Otherwise, you need to look for a different API.



// task 7: keyword searches 
// see also healthcare app.
//  also accept variants

// For example, if the user enters "beach," or "beaches," "Beach" or "BEACH," 
// then you need to write JavaScript code so that it accepts all variations of this keyword.

// For uppercase letters in the keyword, you can convert them to lowercase 
// in your JavaScript using the string manipulation toLowerCase() method.

// Similarly, you need to create logic to match keywords entered for temples and countries.
// its not expected the website can deal with anything else than beach, temple or countries.

// The website should display results only after the user clicks the Search button.> onlick event handler

// task 8: recommendations
// In this task, you need to fetch the details of the places you recommend based on
//  which keyword the user enters: beach, temple, or country.

// For each of these three keywords, your results should display at least two recommendations, an image, and a description. 
// these get rendered to the home page


// task 9: clear button
// Create logic in your JavaScript file for a clear button to clear the results. 
// To implement this feature, you can create a function that will be called after clicking on the clear button in the navbar.



// finally, check the output by cloning the repo into the working environment and running it on server.
// do not forget the git part of it.
